## 🏆 2017 — 3D City Reconstruction from Photos

The 2017 award recognized a research project on **large-scale 3D city reconstruction from photographs**.

The work focused on:
- multi-view 3D reconstruction from unconstrained photo collections,
- robust geometry estimation at urban scale,
- transforming heterogeneous image data into coherent 3D city models.

This project demonstrated how photogrammetry and computer vision techniques could be scaled beyond small scenes, paving the way for applications in urban modeling, simulation, and digital twins.

The project explored:
- real-time AR tracking and rendering,
- spatial understanding of indoor environments,
- interactive visualization of virtual furniture in real spaces.

It highlighted how AR technologies could enhance user experience and decision-making in interior design and real estate contexts.
