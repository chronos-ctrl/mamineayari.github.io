I’m happy to share that I earned the **Foundations of Product Management** certification from **Google**.

This certification provided a structured introduction to the core principles of **product management**, covering how products are:
- defined from user needs,
- shaped by business and technical constraints,
- and delivered through cross-functional collaboration.

## What This Certification Covers

The program focuses on the fundamentals required to build and manage products effectively, including:

- product vision and strategy,
- user-centered problem definition,
- prioritization and roadmap thinking,
- stakeholder alignment,
- collaboration with engineering and design teams.

Rather than tooling or frameworks alone, the emphasis is on **decision-making**, **trade-offs**, and **product thinking**.

## Why It Matters in My Work

Earning this certification complemented my technical background by reinforcing:
- a user-driven mindset,
- clarity around product value,
- and the importance of aligning technology choices with real-world needs.

Whether working on AI systems, platforms, or end-to-end products, these foundations continue to inform how I approach:
- problem framing,
- system design,
- and product execution.
