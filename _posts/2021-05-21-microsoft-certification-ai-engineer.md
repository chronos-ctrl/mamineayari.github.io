## Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Engineer Associate

This certification focuses on designing and implementing **AI solutions in production**, using Azure’s AI and cognitive services.

Key areas covered include:
- building AI-powered applications,
- deploying and managing machine learning models,
- integrating vision, language, and decision services,
- operationalizing AI solutions securely and reliably on Azure.

The program emphasizes **end-to-end AI systems**, from model integration to monitoring and scalability.

## Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Scientist Associate

This certification is centered on the **data science lifecycle**, from data preparation to model training and evaluation.

It covers:
- data exploration and feature engineering,
- training and evaluating machine learning models,
- experimentation and model optimization,
- collaboration between data science and engineering teams.

The focus is on turning data into **actionable, deployable models**, rather than isolated experiments.

## Why These Certifications Matter

Earning these certifications helped formalize and reinforce:
- best practices for cloud-based AI deployment,
- the bridge between **data science and engineering**,
- production constraints such as scalability, reliability, and security.

They complement hands-on experience by grounding it in **cloud-native AI architectures** and industry standards.
